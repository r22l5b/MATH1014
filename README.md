1.             For   each   of   the   following   rational   functions      f,   evaluate   the   antiderivative      ∫   f(x)dx.

2.               Evaluate the following antiderivatives.

3.             (a)             Using the factorization    x4      +   1   =    (x2    − √2x   +   1)(x2      + √2x   +   1),   evaluate

(b)          Using   (a) and the substitution      u    =   √tan   x, evaluate

using the substitution   
5.             (a)             Show that the   polynomial    x   3      +   3x   +   1       has   exactly one   real   root.
(b)          Let    r       be the   real   root of      x   3      +   3x   +   1.             Using a   partial   fraction   decomposition,   evaluate
   
in terms   of      r.
6.             Evaluate the   antiderivatives   of   each   of the   followin代 写MATH1014 Calculus II Problem Set 4 L01 (Spring 2025)C/C++

7.               Let      a      be apositive   real   number.             Evaluate
   
for each of the   following   cases:
(a)            0   <   a   <   1,
(Try to find antiderivatives just on       (−π, π); antiderivativeson      ℝ    are too complicated.)

Hint:                   In (c),   break the   interval   into two   halves, and   let            in the second   half.
10.         Let    f:   [0, +∞)   →   ℝ       be the function
